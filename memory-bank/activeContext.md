# Active Context for Car Dealership Website

## Current Work Focus
We're at the initial setup phase of the car dealership website project. The foundational structure has been established with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. We have also installed necessary dependencies for MongoDB integration and authentication.

Current priorities:
1. Setting up the database connection and models
2. Creating the core UI components
3. Implementing basic pages (home, car listings, car details)
4. Setting up authentication system

## Recent Changes
- Created a new Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Installed MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, and bcrypt dependencies
- Set up the basic project structure and directories
- Created Memory Bank documentation

## Next Steps
1. Create MongoDB connection utility
2. Define Mongoose models for cars, users, and inquiries
3. Implement the homepage layout and components
4. Create car listing and detail page components
5. Set up the authentication system
6. Implement the search and filter functionality
7. Develop the admin dashboard

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Database Structure**: Deciding on the schema design for car listings, including specifications, images, and pricing models.
2. **Authentication Flow**: Considering whether to use custom JWT implementation or integrate with NextAuth.js for more features.
3. **Image Handling**: Evaluating options for image storage (local vs. cloud services like Cloudinary) and optimization.
4. **Search Implementation**: Determining the best approach for implementing advanced search and filtering (client-side vs. server-side).
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Planning the layout and features of the admin interface for managing car listings and user data.
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the site works well on all device sizes, especially for image-heavy car listings.

## Current Challenges
1. Ensuring optimal performance with potentially large image galleries for cars
2. Implementing a robust search system with multiple filter options
3. Creating a secure but user-friendly authentication system
4. Designing an intuitive admin interface for managing listings
