# Product Context for Car Dealership Website

## Why This Project Exists
The car dealership website aims to provide a modern, digital platform for car dealers to showcase their inventory and for potential customers to browse, search, and inquire about vehicles. The digital transformation of the car buying experience helps dealerships reach more customers while providing a convenient way for buyers to shop for cars.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Limited Physical Reach**: Traditional dealerships are constrained by geographic limitations. An online presence extends reach to a wider audience.
2. **Inventory Visibility**: Makes the entire car inventory visible and searchable 24/7.
3. **Efficiency in Car Shopping**: Customers can browse, filter, and compare cars without visiting multiple physical locations.
4. **Dealership Management**: Provides tools for dealers to manage listings, track inquiries, and update content efficiently.

## How It Should Work
1. **For Customers**:
   - Browse featured and all available cars on the homepage
   - Search using filters to find specific vehicles
   - View detailed information about each car
   - Contact the dealership regarding specific vehicles
   - Create an account to save favorites and track inquiries

2. **For Administrators**:
   - Manage the car inventory (add, edit, remove listings)
   - Handle user inquiries and messages
   - Update promotional content and featured vehicles
   - Manage user accounts and permissions

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should easily find cars that match their criteria.
2. **Visual Appeal**: High-quality images and clean design to showcase vehicles effectively.
3. **Fast Performance**: Quick loading times and responsive interactions.
